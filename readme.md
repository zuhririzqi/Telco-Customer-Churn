ðŸ’¡ **SaaS:** How does software as a service work?
SaaS works through the cloud delivery model. A software provider will either host the application and related data using its own servers, databases, networking and computing resources, or it may be an ISV that contracts a cloud provider to host the application in the provider's data center. The application will be accessible to any device with a network connection. SaaS applications are typically accessed via web browsers.

## **Business Context and Task**

Analyzing sales performance is crucial for businesse regardless of their scale. By understanding revenue-driving metrics, companies can make measurable decisions, from pricing, product development, marketing stategies etc. A company growth rate measures specific variables associated with growth over a specific period and is expressed as a percentage. The variables are industry-specific, meaning they differ from one company to another. Company growth rate formula can be applied to any metrics such as revenue, profit, user aqcuisition, and compound annual growth rates (CAGR). Different industries have different growth rates and benchmarks, the average of CAGR in revenue for Software (System & Application) sector is 15,9% and for profit is 16,04% [link](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histgr.html). 

Another important metric for sales performance analysis is profit margins. Profit margins serves as essential indicator of a company's financial health and viability, it expressed as a percentage, represents the portion of a companyâ€™s sales revenue that it gets to keep as a profit, after subtracting all of its costs. Benchmark of profit margin for Software (System & Application) sector is 19,14% [link](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html).

#### **Recomendation**

To achive 1 million dollar sales in 2024 and increasing profit margins by 6% per year, there are some actionable reccomendation based on the data:

1. **Sales**
    - Targeted and personalized promotion to customers with high CLV values based on industry. With the same marketing funds, instead of doing same marketing campaign to all of customer, targeted marketing expected to gain more sales, because higher CLV means higher expected sales.
    - Developing some new feature especially top product (Contact Matcher and Support). Developing some feature in top product will be more cost and time beneficial, instead of developing all product.
    - Try to expand market to gain new customer. There is no addition number of customer from 2020 to 2023, gaining new customer will help to improve sales.


2. **Profit Margins**
    - Limiting discount applied to transaction.
    - Evaluating strategies for pricing, valuing, and promoting products for Contact Matcher.
    - Eliminating low-performing products (Big Ol Database and Marketing Suite)
